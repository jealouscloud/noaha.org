Take care of your team. If they aren't healthy, you won't be.

i could just stop here. Because I care about my self, I won't.

As a team, we are the convergence of technology and strategy.
We are the foundation upon which the company operates.
We are the beacon that guides the next step when that foundation finally develops
a crack.

We operate in infrastructure, which works in domains.

If you don't know how to categorize something, ask the wizard of the castle.
if you don't think they're right, drill down. If all else fails, ask a friend.
_editors note_: this is the right way to treat ai.

If you were wondering what the theme implies we are, we'd be dwarves.

The sign post:

### HELP WANTED

Infrastructure maintainer
Idea haver
Rhythm keeper
Spirit bringer

### HELP NOT WANTED:

- Follower ("I don't follow, but I will agree")
- Poor contributors: Not able to seek
- Disinterested learners: If you aren't taking notes, we aren't taking you.
- Lost, won't tell you.
- Dead eyes
- Does not use git like a human
  - ~~Updated main.py~~
    - What for?
  - ~~code refactor~~
    - Cool: Why did you do this?

So you're the poor sop who they let into the tavern. You beat the quiz and sent
you to the queue. It's a long queue, there's so much they didn't tell you.

And you thought you could help.
You can, just not like you thought.
So day after day, week after week, month after month.

Your soul gets beaten into a pulp
As you molt into a rigid steel gear that turns the corpo calendar forward
one mechanistic moment into the other.

We don't want that to happen to you.
You were bright and interested when you walked through the door.
That's what we wanted. That's why we took you.

This is how we do it.

# Quality Constraints

Every work unit must obey quality constraints.
Green field work is especially hard to qualify.
Tools must be inventoried and cataloged. The bill of requirements cannot be infinite.

Prescriptions

- Tool use must not be mechanistically constrained as to stifle innovation
- Tool selection must satisfy domain requirements

# Domain Definitions

A common understanding of a domain paves the way for structured work.
A domain should be defined with as many of these properties fleshed out as possible.

- Name / identity
- Terms, properties, lingo
- Boundaries of scope
- Tools
- Dependencies and interfaces with other domains
- Key metrics / Success indicators
- Pitfalls, gotchas
- Lessons "I was here so you dont have to"
- Contribution guidelines
- Governance model: Ownership, approval, stakeholders, review frequency
  - If a frequency is mandated but not scheduled it is lip service.

The above list is a strong suggestion but may not always be a perfect fit.

Some key questions to answer when looking at a domain definition:

- How do I find [my component] in [this domain]
- How do I troubleshoot [this issue]
- Where is documentation maintained
- What projects interface with this domain
- What are standard maintenance procedures
- What monitoring exists and what metrics matter
- What are the primary interfaces/APIs for this domain

Structured Work
===============

Dwarves.
We have our tools. Our axe. Our codex.
We like tasks with all the information we need to complete.

### A task
* Definition | Estimate
* Comprehension
* Attempt
* Result

I would like to use this as the core unit.
Tasks are punched in.
You may end up on a tangent.
Log where your tangent took you.
If the task deviates as written, you:
* Remove the estimate
* Give a comment regarding the deviation
* Change the task status to pending review

When you exceed the estimate, a message blips in a channel. You're pinged and ask if you need help


# Solid Contributions

Ideally, a structure exists.
