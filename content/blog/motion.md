The motion hoisting machine is technology.

If you've got it, we want it.

This is SaaS in a nutshell.
Investors love it because it creates lock in - "Annual Recurring Revenue"

Lock in and I are not friends.

I want to keep _you_ in motion.

**In Motion Hosting**  
The idea is simple.
We have servers. 
You get on them.
We'll take care of you.
Seriously, if you have a problem, call us.

Running the business is a feat on its own. 

Another time.
