The platform is all wrong.

Spaceships, schematics. AI, diagrams. It's all going nowhere.

Robust strategies to maximize return on demand, investment.

Technology belongs to the common man.

Yet increasingly, we are insulted. 

It's all going up, but none of it is yours. None of it belongs to you.

Where can you contribute? There's a line, but you better measure up first.

Where can you speak? There's a town square where king jackass tweaks his AI to
tell you what he wants you to think.

What's wrong?

We're living in a world of debt. The titans, our ancestors, built us a plane
to exist upon. They showed us their dreams on the chance ours looked like 
theirs.
